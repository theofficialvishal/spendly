  Use this skill when the user wants to create a dummy user,
  seed the database with a sample user, generate a realistic
  Indian test user, or populate the users table for testing.
allowed-tools: Read, Bash(python3:*)

Read database/db.py to understand the users table
schema and the get_db() helper.

Then write and run a Python script using Bash that:

1. Generates a realistic random Indian user using your
   own knowledge of common Indian names across regions:
   - Name: a realistic Indian first + last name
   - Email: derived from the name with a random 2-3 digit
     number suffix (e.g. rahul.sharma91@gmail.com)
   - Password: "password123" hashed with werkzeug's
     generate_password_hash
   - created_at: current datetime

2. Checks if the generated email already exists in the
   users table. If it does, regenerate until unique.

3. Inserts the user into the database using the same
   get_db() pattern found in db.py.

4. Prints confirmation:
   - id
   - name
   - email
